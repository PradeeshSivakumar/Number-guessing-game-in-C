Number Guessing Game
Hi guys! ðŸŽ®

I'm excited to share my latest project: a simple yet fun Number Guessing Game developed in C! In this game, players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, with a maximum of five attempts. Each guess provides instant feedback, letting players know if they need to guess higher or lower.

Features:

1.Random number generation
2.User-friendly interface with prompts and feedback
3.Limited attempts for added challenge

Technologies Used:

C programming language
This project is a great way to practice programming fundamentals like loops, conditionals, and random number generation. Feel free to check it out, give it a try, and contribute if you have ideas for improvements!

Letâ€™s make learning to code fun! ðŸš€
